MissingOutputException in rule semi_coherent_analysis in file /home/jiajun/physics_benchmarks/benchmarks/zdc_lyso/Snakefile, line 31:
Job 1  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
results/epic/zdc_lyso/plots.pdf
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
